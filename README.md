## What it does - TLDR
Automatically downloads latest price data to your local PC / uploads price data when you do an AH scan, mimicking what the official TSM app (used on retail WoW) does. As they describe it: "keeps your addon data up-to-date".<br>
In other words, you will always have access to the most recent prices and all the other TSM data points you love!<br>

## What it does - non-TLDR
When first run, it will ask you whether you want to create a scheduled task to run the app on startup (input Y or N in the console and press Enter). This will happen only when first running the script. The idea behind it running on startup is due to the fact that we can only update data in the WTF folder when WoW is not running, because each /reload, logout to char select or game restart automatically writes to the files (ie it would rewrite what we put there). Hence whenever you launch WoW you will have the latest data there is. More info in the FAQ section below.<br>
When first run, it will also create `update_times.json` in the directory where the EXE file is saved which tracks what LUA file got last updated. Don't mess with this file.

There are two core functionalities:<br>
- Data download
  - Downloads newest data from the DB.
  - Happens ONLY when WoW is not running and is being downloaded every 5 minutes.
- Data upload
  - When you do a scan, could be partial or full, please do a /reload when you can. This will make the game write to the LUA file, get detected by the app and uploaded to the DB.
  - The script checks for changes every 5 minutes.

BTW, the app runs in command line. When you run TSM Data Sharing App.exe it opens the console and starts working right away, ie there is no install.
